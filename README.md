# AI-INTERACTION-DEEPLAKE

<h5>The AI-Interaction-DeepLake project leverages Activeloop's Deep Lake to store, manage, and retrieve large-scale datasets effectively while utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model for natural language processing. This project involves setting up environment variables, instantiating models, creating and managing datasets, and creating an intelligent agent to interact with the dataset. </h5>
  
Below are the detailed steps for setting up and running this project:


<h2> 1) Activeloop Key Saved in the “ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN” Environment Variable: </h2>

The first step is to ensure that your Activeloop API key is stored securely in the environment variable ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN. This key is required to authenticate and interact with Deep Lake datasets.

<h2> 2) Instantiate the LLM and Embeddings Models - GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct: </h2>

Instantiate the GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model along with embeddings models. This involves setting up the OpenAI API key and configuring the models to be used for generating embeddings and handling language tasks.

<h2> 3) Create Deep Lake Dataset and Add Documents: </h2>

Create a new Deep Lake dataset using the Activeloop library. Documents or data are then added to this dataset, which could include text, images, or other types of data that need to be managed and retrieved efficiently.

<h2> 4) Create a Retriever from the DB: </h2>

Once the dataset is populated, create a retriever from the database. This retriever is responsible for fetching relevant data from the dataset based on the input query or prompt.

<h2> 5) Create an Agent That Uses the Tool and Prints the Response: </h2>

Develop an intelligent agent that uses the retriever tool to interact with the dataset. This agent will take user inputs, query the dataset using the retriever, and print the relevant responses generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model.
